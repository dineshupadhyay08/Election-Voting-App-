## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User logs in
2. Backend generates JWT
3. JWT stored in **HTTP-only cookie**
4. Every protected request validates token via middleware
5. Role (`isAdmin`) decides access level

---

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside `server/`:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SRCRET=your_jwt_secret
```
